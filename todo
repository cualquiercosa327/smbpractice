# todo

- faster resume, use resume checkpoints every N'th frame.
  would be really nice to have every 500 frame, but it consumes a lot of rom-space (7 bytes / seed).

- fix any% vs. warpless (+ default rules for both too).

- add default rule (need rules, i am too fucking bad).

- maybe use github-Ã­ssues over this crap? :)

# done

- no rule on 1-1 (done)
- No game over (done)
